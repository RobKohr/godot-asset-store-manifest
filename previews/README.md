A previews directory can contain files for screenshots and movies to show what what an asset is like.


This directory will be ignored in the file tree display in the store. If "previews" array isn't set in the manifest.json, then this directory will be scanned and used in alphabetical order. Otherwise, the array in the manifest will be used for the previews.
